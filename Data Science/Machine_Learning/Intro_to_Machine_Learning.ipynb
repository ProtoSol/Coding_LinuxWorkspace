    "1. **Problem Formulation**: Define the problem you want to solve and identify the key performance indicators\n",
    "2. **Data Collection**: Get the Relevant data from various sources and combine them together in single data sheet.\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**: Converting the Raw data to Clean data, by removing the Anomalies / Outliers / Missing values etc\n",
    "4. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning the data by removing unecessary features, One line Hot encoding etc.\n",
    "5. **EDA**: Get to know the data and the purpose of the data.\n",
    "6. **Choose a Model**: Choose the model based on the type of data to be used.\n",
    "    - `Regression`: For predicting continous numerical data.\n",
    "    - `Classification`: For predicting the class of the predicted data point.\n",
    "    - `Clustering`: Make cluster/group of the data.\n",
    "7. **Splitting the Data**: Split the data into two parts Independent Variable (Features) and Dependent Variable (Labels).\n",
    "8. **Model Training**: Train the model using the Independent Variable (Features) and Dependent Variable\n",
    "9. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using the metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,\n",
    "    - `Accuracy`: The ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.\n",
    "    - `Precision`: The ratio of correct positive predictions to total positive predictions.\n",
    "    - `Recall`: The ratio of correct positive predictions to total actual positive predictions.\n",
    "10. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model in production environment.\n",
    "11. **Model Monitoring**: Monitor the model performance and update the model if necessary.\n",
    "12. **Model Maintenance**: Maintain the model by updating the model if necessary.\n",
    "13. **Model Retraining**: Retrain the model if necessary.\n",
    "14. **Model Explanation**: Explain the model to the stakeholders.\n"
